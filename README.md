Business Recommendations
Here are some simple, actionable recommendations for Aerofit based on the insights:

Target the 23-26 Age Group: Since the majority of users fall within this age range, focus marketing efforts on this demographic by creating ads and promotional content tailored to younger adults, highlighting the benefits of fitness and health maintenance.

Offer Price-Tiered Treadmills: Align treadmill models with income levels. For example, market KP281 to users with annual incomes of 40,000 to 46,000 dollars, KP481 to users around 50,000 dollars, and KP781 to higher-income individuals (76,000+ dollars). This income-based segmentation can optimize sales by catering to customer affordability.

Emphasize Mid-Level Fitness for KP281 and KP481: Most users rate themselves at a moderate fitness level of 3. Promote KP281 and KP481 as ideal for users aiming for regular, moderate exercise routines (3-4 times a week).

Promote KP781 for High-Mileage Users: Users who plan to run or walk 160 miles per week prefer KP781. Highlight its advanced features and durability in marketing to fitness enthusiasts who engage in high-mileage routines.

Leverage Male KP781 Buyers: Since the high-end KP781 is more popular among male users, tailor advertisements for KP781 with male-centric messaging, showcasing its suitability for intense workouts and higher usage frequency.

Educate Based Marketing: Users with more than 16 years of education prefer KP781. Use educational content, such as detailed product brochures or blog posts, to appeal to this group. Highlight how the advanced features of KP781 support high fitness goals.

Encourage Partnered Users: Since users with partners are more likely to purchase treadmills, develop promotions offering discounts or bundle deals for couples or families to boost sales.

Focus on Usage Frequency: Since 85% of users plan to use treadmills 4 times or less per week, emphasize that KP281 and KP481 are designed for light-to-moderate regular use, whereas KP781 is better suited for more frequent, intensive use.

Fitness Correlation Promotions: Promote KP781 as ideal for high fitness level users (fitness level 5), who also plan to use it for more miles and more frequently per week. Tailor fitness challenge programs that cater to high-end treadmill users.
